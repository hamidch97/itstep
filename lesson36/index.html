                    <article>In line with the recommendations of the Abidjan conference, the FAO and OIE have
                        established a joint secretariat and in April 2016 concluded consultations to develop a Global
                        Control and Eradication Programme based on the adopted Strategy. The PPR Eradication Program
                        Secretariat is chaired by Bouna Diop and includes coordinators from FAO and OIE, respectively
                        Felix Njeumi and Jean-Jacques Soula.</article>

                        officers, epidemiologists and other experts in affected countries are being made aware of

                    <article>Existing quality vaccines are effective and affordable, so global eradication is
                        technically feasible. However, delivery systems to ensure their efficacy and access by remote
                        agropastoralist communities need to be established.
                        Implementation of the eradication programme also offers an ideal entry point for dialogue with
                        pastoralist communities, notably in the Sahel, that can catalyse both greater resilience and the
                        provision of other services leading to improved governance and stability.</article>

                        easier differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals — may be developed that are less
                        expensive or better suited for purpose. Diagnostic laboratory capacity and competency will also

                    <article>Progression from control to eradication of the disease will require a persistent and

                        require intensive targeted vaccination programs aimed at reaching 80 percent of all animals,
                        followed by the post-vaccination evaluation phase in order to achieve compliance with the
